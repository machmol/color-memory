# color-memory V1.0

This was one of my fist finished little projects using html, css, javascript.

In order to sharpen my skills I set up the following requirements for my self: 

### Requirements:

- html “grid” should be used
- a simple form should be applied incl. html validation
- make the website interactive with some javascript
- simple css styling without images.
- make it responsive

### Outcome V1.0

- Grid has been applied, and automatically is populated via javascript :white_check_mark:
- The form only has one input field on which simple html validations has been applied :sunglasses: :white_check_mark:
- Website is a little game, therefore - interactivity :white_check_mark:
- No fancy styling has been applied. I wanted the styling to be as simple as possible for the sake of learning javascript. :white_check_mark:
- It is kind of responsive, one more media query would seal the deal for mobile as well. :no_entry_sign:
